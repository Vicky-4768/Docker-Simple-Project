### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-collector.git
cd weather-data-collector
```

### Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeather API key:

```dotenv
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mysql_root_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=weather_db
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_user_password
```
