That sounds like an exciting project! Let's create an attractive `README.md` for your GitHub repository. I'll also include the Docker build and run commands for creating the image and running the container.

Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` for your project:

# Weather Data Collector

This project is a Python application that collects weather data from the OpenWeather API and stores it in a MySQL database. It is designed for Docker practice and demonstrates how to use Docker to containerize a Python application.

## Features

- Fetch weather data from OpenWeather API
- Store weather data in a MySQL database
- Dockerized application for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- OpenWeather API Key

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-collector.git
cd weather-data-collector
```

### Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenWeather API key:

```dotenv
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mysql_root_password
MYSQL_DATABASE=weather_db
MYSQL_USER=your_mysql_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_user_password
```

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t weather-data-collector .
```

### Run Docker Container

```bash
docker run --name weather-container --env-file .env -d weather-data-collector
```

### Access MySQL Database

To access the MySQL database running inside the container, use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it mysql-container mysql -u root -p
```

Enter the root password from your `.env` file.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it weather-container python main.py
```
